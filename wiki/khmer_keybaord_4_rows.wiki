This is the new Keyboard 4 Rows delivered with the new v0.4 <br>
This version is available here for download and is available Monday 24 August on Cydia.<br>
<br>
I prefer more this new version than my previous one. <br>
The Target of this new keyboard was to have a look and feel iPhone and to be as close as possible of the NIDA mapping.<br>
You can find NIDA keyboard mapping on http://www.khmeros.info <br>
<br>
<br>

On this iPhone Keyboard the Invisible Space, is available with Shift + Space. Due to Technical constraint, I didn't find a better way than to put it on the Shift + Space.<br>
<br>
<br>
Some people will like it, others will not. This is perfectly normal. <br>

<br>
Same as in the english world, some people likes the QWERTY 4 rows, some the 5 rows, some the Colmak keyboard, some with other colors, shape ... <br>
<br>
The most important is that you feel good using the one you like
<br>
<br>
I hope to see the other type of keyboards available soon for all who want to write Khmer on their iPhone. <br>
