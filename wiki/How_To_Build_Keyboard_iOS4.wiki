= How to make a custom Keyboard for iOS 4 =

This wiki will describe what changed on the iOS 4 for the keyboard.

First of all, I would like to thanks KennyTM (iKeyex) for his great blog and great description of the keyboard engine on iOS 3.x. 
His explanation were clear enough, for me to follow the same reasoning, and then update his tool to generate keyboard for the Khmer community for the iOS4.
He suspended his project up to May 2011. I guessed, he was busy enough to not be disturb.

I will describe the minimum of change to have a working keyboard. At least this changes made the Khmer keyboard possible.
