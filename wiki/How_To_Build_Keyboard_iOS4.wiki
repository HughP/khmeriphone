= How to make a custom Keyboard for iOS 4 =

This wiki will describe what changed on the iOS 4 for the keyboard.

First of all, I would like to thanks KennyTM (iKeyex) for his great blog and great description of the keyboard engine on iOS 3.x. <br>
His explanation were clear enough, for me to follow the same reasoning, and then update his tool to generate keyboard for the Khmer community for the iOS4. <br>
<br>
He suspended his project up to May 2011. I guessed, he was busy enough to not be disturb. <br>
This web site is not affiliated to his. I only thank him, as without him none of this could have been possible.
<br>
<br>
I will describe the minimum of change to be made in order to have a working keyboard. <br>
At least this changes made the Khmer keyboard possible.
