First of all, I would like to thanks KennyTM, creator of iKeyex, for his great blog and great description of the keyboard engine on iOS 3.x. <br>
His explanation were clear enough, for me to follow the same reasoning, and then update his tool to generate keyboard for the Khmer community for the iOS4. <br>
<br>
He suspended his project up to May 2011. I guessed, he was busy enough to not be disturbed. <br>
My web site is not affiliated to his site. I only wanted to thank him and give him credit, as without him none of this could have been possible.
<br>
<br>
I will describe the minimum of change to be made in order to have a working keyboard. <br>
At least these minimum changes made the Khmer keyboard possible. <br> <br> <br>
