I just converted the dictionary to Stardict format, nothing more than this.  <br>
I have no credit at all. And I'm not affiliated in anyway to the above website. <br>

<blockquote><br>
<br>
For installing the dictionary in your iPhone.  <br>
<br>
Connect to your iPhone via SSH. <br>
<br>
Browse to /private/var/mobile/Applications/   as per image below. <br>
Here are stored all your applications that you got from iTunes.<br>
I'm sorry but the following part is @#@$@!, let's say ... takes time.  <br>

All these strange numbers are applications <br>
Open them one by one, until you find your Dictionary application. In my example I'm looking for wedict. <br>
In all of them you will find the name of your application  .app <br>
Below WeDict.app  <br>

After that go to Documents ...<br>

And drop the files in it <br></blockquote>

Then you can open your dictionary, and the new dictionary will be available. <br></blockquote>
