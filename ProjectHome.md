<h2>Update 12 September 2010 : New Cydia Repo up and running</h2>

The Package is available at the new cydia repo <a href='http://cydia.myrepospace.com/Kmiphone/'>http://cydia.myrepospace.com/Kmiphone/</a>


If you want to know more about the package content : <a href='http://code.google.com/p/khmeriphone/wiki/iOS4'>http://code.google.com/p/khmeriphone/wiki/iOS4</a>

<br>

NB: The font bug in the new font arialuni.ttf is remaining in this version when trying to type more than 32 characters. I couldn't spend more time to try to fix the bug. I still have to work on the khmer keyboard for iPad.<br>
<br>
<br>

<h2>Update 10 September 2010 : Current Package Status</h2>

iOS4 Keyboard & Fonts Packages and New Cydia repo will be coming this week-end.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<h2>Update 08 September 2010 : Current Package Status</h2>

I currently base the new font on the font for Mac OS X created by Mr. Danh Hong.<br>
I got his authorisation to use it in the future package.<br>
<br>
I started to ask beta tester to test the current package.<br>
<br>
The current issue is with this new font. It seems that the font has issues if more than 32 glyphs are displayed in 1 line. I informed Mr. Danh Hong about this issue.<br>
<br>
Hope to release the package soon<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<h2>Update 26 August 10 : Keyboard iOS 4. Completed.</h2>

Font used for the keyboard are based on the glyphs from Khmer OS Sieam Reap which is a Free Font.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Information</b> : It seems that the previous font used in the package was from a copyrighted font. <br>
I then removed the font package from this web site. <br>
I will try to find another font, free, for Mac OS X, in order to  adapt it to iPhone. <br>
I will update the progress.<br>
<br>
<br>

<h2>Update 25 August 10 : Cydia Package update for ios4 (4.0, 4.0.1, iPhone 4 ...) update coming soon...</h2>

Sorry for answering late to everybody. So far, I was not planning to update the package for iOS4 due to time constraint on my side. Busy with work ;)<br>
<br>
But as I do not see yet full package available on other web sites, and as many of you are still waiting to use<br>
your new iPhone with Khmer package...<br>
<br>
I then started last week to work on an upgrade of the package.<br>
<br>
Everything should be easy updatable by many people on the community. (fonts, fix locale, translation ...)<br>
Except the keyboard. The keyboard is an issue.<br>
<br>
But after 3 days of reverse engineering of the iPhone 4 UIKit file. I finally get a working tool to generate keyboards.<br>
Here is the first screenshots results from my iPhone 4.<br>
This layout is for testing purpose. The final layout will follow the same layout as before.<br>
The keyboard is working good so far ...<br>
<br>

iPad Status: iPad keyboard follow more less the same logic. I'm today able to generate keyboard for it.<br>
But I still need to work on few things, as the dimension of the keyboard for the iPad are not ok.<br>
